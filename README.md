Making instagram homepage from scratch
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======

# Task
Your task is to re-build the instagram homework from scratch with bootstrap. You must create a new repo and follow our github practices.

1. You must use the bootstrap grid system
2. You must do a pull-request by 9am Monday morning

# Difficulties
When using the grid system, I had the mindset that the contents within each grid has to fill out the grid container itself. Until I realised that I could make another container within each grid such that I can position it easier. Forgot to work on dev branch.

#Pleased
I am happy that I managed to get it closer to looking like the Instagram homepage.
